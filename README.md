# work-day-starter-code

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

My commits are not very on discriptive as I am/was still figuring out what to write for my commits. I haven't been quite sure but as of the time I am writing this I hope the updates I am making reflect a more discriptive commit read. 

## Description
This is a webpage to display a scheulde from 8am to 5pm and save it to your computer. On the webpage you can see what you have set up for the day. Along with using it as a place to see what tasks you have for the day. This page was developing using JAVASCRIPT and basic coding structure.
